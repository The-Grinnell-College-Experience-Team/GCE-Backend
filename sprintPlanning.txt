# Sprint Planning 1
Date: Feb 23, 2024
* This sprint planning is the copy of gradescope submission.
1. Capacity
	- Moiz: ~ 4 hrs (Wed and Thu)
	- Alex: ~ 4 hrs (Wed and Thu)
	- Jasper: 4~5 hrs
	- Autumn: approx. 5 hrs (Tue - Thu)
2. Goals
	- Sprites and Arts: Scene Drawing
	- Backend: Porting from C to C++, Implement character movement and NPC dialogue
3. Task Breakdown
	- Scene Drawing: Sketch each scene and map of the game.
	- Character Movement: Ensure that our character can move in the gridspace.
						  The reason why we need to work on this for now is because
						  we need to also determine how it might work given that we change the grid size as well.
	- NPC Dialogue: We need to implement some form of NPCs such that we can speak to them.
					We also need to plan out how exactly we want the NPCs in what they say and who they are.
	- Port from C to C++: We will need to make sure that we can compile using a C++ compiler,
						  then we might want to reassign some of the structs into becoming classes,
						  just so that we can have some scalability for the future.
						  We don't think we use any cases of memory allocation in the starting code,
						  but if we do then we will go ahead and implement smart pointers to make our lives easier.
4. Assignment
	- Moiz: Port from C to C++
	- Alex: NPC Dialogue
	- Jasper: Draw the scene and help with porting
	- Autumn: Character Movement
5. Issue Tracker
	- We will store everything in our Github Team backlog:
