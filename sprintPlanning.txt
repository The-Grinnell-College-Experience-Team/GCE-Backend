# Sprint Planning 2
Date: Mar 03, 2024
1. Capacity
	- Moiz: The same as last sprint.
	- Alex: The same as last sprint.
	- Jasper: The same as last sprint.
	- Autumn: The same as last sprint.
	Since there was a significant change in our project between the last and current sprint,
	we will keep our capacity as the last sprint.
2. Goals
	- Be familiarized with Godot
	- Add Characters
	- Create NPC Dialogues and NPC Art
	- Basic Tile Map Art
3. Task Breakdown
	- Familiarized with Godot: This is the new game engine that will use for our game, 
							   so we need to spend some time on studying how to use it.
	- Add Characters: Add a simple character moving in a map.
	- Create NPC Dialogues: Create NPC dialouge system (e.g. new windows, pop-ups) and its class
	- Create NPC Art: Design art for NPC system.
	- Basic Tile Map Art: Design the basic tile map for each scene.
4. Assignment
	- Moiz: Add Characters
	- Alex: NPC Art
	- Jasper: Basic Tile Map Art
	- Autumn: NPC Dialogue
	Everyone will also study Godot.

# Sprint Planning 1
Date: Feb 23, 2024
* This sprint planning is the copy of gradescope submission.
1. Capacity
	- Moiz: ~ 4 hrs (Wed and Thu)
	- Alex: ~ 4 hrs (Wed and Thu)
	- Jasper: 4~5 hrs
	- Autumn: approx. 5 hrs (Tue - Thu)
2. Goals
	- Sprites and Arts: Scene Drawing
	- Backend: Porting from C to C++, Implement character movement and NPC dialogue
3. Task Breakdown
	- Scene Drawing: Sketch each scene and map of the game.
	- Character Movement: Ensure that our character can move in the gridspace.
						  The reason why we need to work on this for now is because
						  we need to also determine how it might work given that we change the grid size as well.
	- NPC Dialogue: We need to implement some form of NPCs such that we can speak to them.
					We also need to plan out how exactly we want the NPCs in what they say and who they are.
	- Port from C to C++: We will need to make sure that we can compile using a C++ compiler,
						  then we might want to reassign some of the structs into becoming classes,
						  just so that we can have some scalability for the future.
						  We don't think we use any cases of memory allocation in the starting code,
						  but if we do then we will go ahead and implement smart pointers to make our lives easier.
4. Assignment
	- Moiz: Port from C to C++
	- Alex: NPC Dialogue
	- Jasper: Draw the scene and help with porting
	- Autumn: Character Movement
5. Issue Tracker
	- We will store everything in our Github Team backlog:
