# Sprint Review

The purpose of this sprint review is to record what our team has completed in each sprint 
in terms of experimentation, setup, and product development.

Each sprint review answers to the questions below:
    1. How has your product improved or progressed from a customer perspective?
    2. What progress have you made that is not visible to a common user?


# Sprint Review 1
Date: Feb 27, 2024
1. In this sprint, we decided ...
    - how the user moves the characters (dragging instead of arrows, touch, etc.)
    - how the game shows the NPC dialogue (pop-ups instead of full screen)
2. We decided the grid and pixel size for the game and ported the game engine from the original C code to C++.
    However, we may swap to established game engine such as Unity or Godot.
