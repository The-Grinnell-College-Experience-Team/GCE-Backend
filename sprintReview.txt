# Sprint Review

The purpose of this sprint review is to record what our team has completed in each sprint 
in terms of experimentation, setup, and product development.

Each sprint review answers to the questions below:
    1. How has your product improved or progressed from a customer perspective?
    2. What progress have you made that is not visible to a common user?

# Sprint Review 4
Date: Apr 05, 2024
1. After this sprint, the customers now can ...
    - start the game from the main menu. (For now, only New Game and Quit buttons are available.)
    - walk around the part of the campus (JRC) and experience the Grinnell campus.
    - have a conversation with multiple NPCs.
    - start a battle when they meet combat NPC.
2. In this sprint, we ...
    - created more interaction NPC objects (for conversation) and combat NPC object (for the battle scene).
    - added the pixel arts for JRC map.
    - created main menu scene and added the music source.
    - created the battle scene and built a simple battle system (Attack and Quit buttons).
    - added the instruction for how to build/test/run the entire system to README.

# Sprint Review 3
Date: Mar 12, 2024
1. After this sprint, the customers now can ...
    - meet the NPC and have a simple conversation with it.
2. In this sprint, we ...
    - created a NPC object with the sample sprite.
    - implemented NPC interaction (pop-up windows and a simple conversation).
    - designed pixel arts (main character, trees, etc.) for the game scenes.
    - built test-automation infrastructure by using GitHub Actions and added some sample tests.
        (We pushed the sprint review before its deadline 
        but added the last one since it was mentioned to do in milestone 6)

# Sprint Review 2
Date: Mar 05, 2024
1. In this sprint, we ...
    - created the sample characters and implemented their movement.
    - made a barebone system that sets up a giant map.
    These implementation will be further developed in detail to suit our game in a later sprint.
2. This is not exactly about the actual development, but discussed about 
    - our game's architecture and design.
    - which classes will we make for each component.
    - what can be added to our game since the game engine can already handle most of the basic game features.

# Sprint Review 1
Date: Feb 27, 2024
1. In this sprint, we decided ...
    - how the user moves the characters (dragging instead of arrows, touch, etc.)
    - how the game shows the NPC dialogue (pop-ups instead of full screen)
2. We decided the grid and pixel size for the game and ported the game engine from the original C code to C++.
    However, we may swap to established game engine such as Unity or Godot.
